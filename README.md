A progressive web app to calculate resistor value given its color.
==================================================================

It is currently in development. But you can find a working example [here](https://pwas-1.firebaseapp.com/resistor/). Service worker is not implemented so you can't take it offline now.

To Do
-----
* Improve the calculation algo to include tolerance
* Complete service worker implementation.
* Make manifest and prompt user to add on homescreen.
